# MeetLinks - Add Google Meet Links to each Google Classroom box
MeetLinks is a Google Chrome Extension which will render Google Meet links for each classroom you joined on Google Classroom. Links may differ from course, project or laboratory links. I developed this one to solve my own problem with finding each Google Meet link for each course or laboratory.

### Usage
1. Download / Clone the project folder
2. Go to Chrome > Extensions
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Load Unpacked Extension and choose the project folder

- Open Google Classroom to sync your rooms for the first time
- Open the MeetLinks extension from the extensions tab
- Begin adding links
